Project Overview
The "Global University Analytics Success" dashboard provides an in-depth look at global higher education trends, using data-driven insights to assess university performance across multiple countries. Developed in Power BI, this dashboard enables users to explore essential metrics, such as ranking trends, country comparisons, and student demographics, through interactive visuals. This tool empowers educators, students, and policy makers with valuable information to monitor academic trends, track shifts in rankings, and support informed decision-making.

Objectives
The project was designed with the following core objectives in mind:

University Rankings: Compare and analyze global university rankings to reveal the distribution of high-performing institutions across various regions.
Critical Success Factors: Identify the factors most influential in university success, such as faculty-student ratios, international student ratios, and research impact.
Regional Insights: Provide a closer look at the regional trends, allowing insights into national education systems' strengths and areas for improvement.

Dataset Details
This project utilized a comprehensive dataset including:

Countries: A representative set of countries covered by each ranking system.
Universities: An extensive list of universities, each linked to country and ranking data.
Ranking Systems: Data from three ranking systems (Times Higher Education, Shanghai Ranking, and CWUR), with criteria like citations, quality of education, and research impact.
Ranking Criteria: Specific criteria used in each ranking system, contributing to an institution's total score.
Yearly Metrics: Year-wise statistics on student numbers, faculty-student ratios, and ranking scores.

Data Preprocessing
The data preparation process involved several key steps to ensure accuracy and relevance:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized university and country names for consistency.
Data Transformation: Created new metrics, including student success rates and faculty-to-student ratios, to capture essential trends.
Data Reduction: Filtered out irrelevant columns to enhance dashboard performance, focusing on variables like university rankings, research output, and graduation rates.

Dashboard Views
Country Analysis: Highlights top-performing countries in higher education, with the U.S., U.K., Australia, Germany, and Canada leading in international student enrollment. Countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Israel show significant gender diversity in higher education.
University Analysis: Analyzes institutions like Arizona State University, University of Massachusetts, and University of Toronto, which lead in total student numbers, as well as universities with high international student representation and optimal student-staff ratios.
Ranking Analysis: Compares ranking systems (CWUR, Times Higher Education, and Shanghai Ranking) on metrics such as gender diversity and student-staff ratios. CWUR ranks the highest number of universities, while Times Higher Education has the best student-staff ratio.
Yearly Analysis: Tracks educational growth, gender diversity, and enrollment trends across years, revealing peaks and declines. Key findings include increased female student enrollment through 2016 and rapid university expansion after 2012.

Insights
Diversity and International Appeal: High-ranking universities attract more international students and offer favorable student-staff ratios, pointing to the influence of faculty resources on ranking.
Gender Representation: Data shows a moderate positive correlation between ranking scores and female student percentage, emphasizing the role of gender diversity in higher education success.
Growth Trends: Between 2006 and 2016, international student percentages grew significantly, alongside a steady rise in total student enrollment, peaking in 2014 and 2015.

Presentation
This project was showcased at SDBI, where we presented the dashboardâ€™s functionality and its implications for data-driven decision-making in the academic sector. The response was highly positive, affirming the dashboardâ€™s potential as a valuable resource for stakeholders in education.

Conclusion
This Global University Success Analysis Dashboard has been instrumental in enhancing our understanding of global education systems, highlighting success factors and trends that contribute to university performance. It serves as a practical example of how data visualization can simplify complex information for impactful insights.
